# Datasets
Datasets managed by Git LFS (Large File Storage)

## Operating Git LFS
Refer [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for installation

## MongoDB
Make sure that:
1. you have the `dump` directory, which contains binary exports of the Mongo database
2. you have `mongod` running in a shell

Then, we are going to use `mongorestore` which converts the binary files into proper MongoDB instance:
`mongorestore <path-to>/dump`
